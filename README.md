# UltraLite-Fisheries-Data-System

This is a worked example of a very robust data management approach for fisheries data. 

## Purpose

The approach is robust in terms of actual implementation for a very specific type of setting, specifically situations where a small number of people try to maintain an up-to-date data set of annual estimates for a group of stocks, with source data coming from different assessment programs and agencies.
The annual estimates typically come with important context and annual caveats for interpretation, which needs to be compiled in some format that is easily accessible. 

The approach was originally developed for compiling and maintaining data for Yukon River Chinook salmon, which combines outputs from 31 main assessment surveys covering a basin of 850,000 km^2 [Pestal et al. 2022](https://www.psc.org/download/33/psc-technical-reports/14359/psc-technical-report-no-48.pdf). 33 people from 11 organizations contributed to the data compilation and review process.

*Important: This approach is not designed to track large amounts of raw data (e.g., individual records from genetic sampling or hydroacoustic tagging programs), but to facilitate and track the synthesis of these pieces into an overall picture of available information*
