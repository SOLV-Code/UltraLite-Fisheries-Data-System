# PLOTS

This folder contains various plots generated from the source data. In this illustration, we are tracking the plots on git, so that they are available for download from the repository. This is not a problem here, because the data will not change much, and there will be few revisions to the plots. 

However, in a real application, *png* and *pdf* files would be excluded from tracking, because github would keep a copy of each previous version, leading to potential memory problems in the long run.
You can exclude individual files, file types, or whole subfolders from tracking in the [.gitignore file](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/UltraLite-Fisheries-Data-System/blob/main/.gitignore).
