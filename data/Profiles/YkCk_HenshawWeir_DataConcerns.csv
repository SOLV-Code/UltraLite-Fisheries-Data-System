"2000, 2003","The weir was only operational for part of the season due to high water for most of the season, which caused the counting schedule to be interrupted at times.  On occasions when water level rose high enough to impede the counting schedule the weir remained intact but weir panels were submerged allowing fish to pass undetected."
2006,"The first summer chum salmon was counted on June 30.  Daily escapement counts, hydrological and weather information were reported seven days a week by satellite phone to the FFWFO.  Due to heavy rains, the Henshaw Creek weir flooded on July 1 and remained flooded for the rest of the field season.  By July 27, the water level had dropped sufficiently to remove the weir.  "
2007,"The first Chinook and summer chum salmon were counted on July 2.    Due to heavy rains, the Henshaw Creek weir flooded on July 16 through 1430 on July 21 and again on August 6.  The preliminary escapement count was 569 Chinook salmon, and 32,085 summer chum salmon. Missed counts were interpolated postseason and annual estimate updated."
2010,The weir was operational beginning on June 23 and ending August 8. Two interruptions to weir operations occurred due to high water events: July 7 – 9 and July 22. Daily estimates of Chinook and summer chum salmon passage were estimated for the days that were missed due to high water by using linear interpolation as outlined in the methods section of the annual report.
2013,"The weir was operational beginning on June 30 and ending on August 5. One high water event interrupted weir operations and suspended enumeration efforts for nearly four and a half days, beginning at 22:45 hours on July 9 and ending at 12:00 hours on July 14. The partially enumerated days of July 9 and 14 were adjusted to provide full day passage estimates. However, no interpolation was made to estimate the passage for the complete missed days, July 10 – 13. No interpolation was made due to the timing of the high water event coupled with the size of the escapement on July 9 and July 14. The first day of escapement for both species was July 9. Estimated escapement on July 9 was one Chinook salmon and 42,528 chum salmon. During the period of interruption, the trap door on the weir was left closed, blocking passage of salmon for 3.5 days of the 4.5 day period. The trap door was opened to allow for unimpeded migration for the last 24 hours of the 4.5 day period. While the trap door was closed, it is assumed that the majority of both salmon species were unable to migrate upstream of the weir. However, it is possible that a portion of both salmon species were able to migrate over the weir as the weir was underwater during this high water event.   "
2014,"The weir was not installed nor operated due to sustained flooding in Henshaw Creek. High water persisted from mid-June through July 29, at which point in time the decision was made to forgo weir installation as the majority of the run had already passed through the weir site."
2016,"Two high water events interrupted weir operations. The first high water event occurred between 09:00 hours on July 5 and 23:59 hours on July 8. This event temporarily suspended ASL sampling, but did not suspend escapement enumeration. The second high water event occurred between 19:30 and 22:00 hours on July 11. This event suspended escapement enumeration. The trap door was left open during this event as to not block passage through the weir. The partially enumerated day of July 11 was adjusted to a full day count using linear interpolation as outlined in the methods sections of the annual report."
2018,"The weir was not installed nor operated due to sustained flooding in Henshaw Creek. High water persisted from mid-June through July 21, at which point in time the decision was made to forgo weir installation as the majority of the run had already passed through the weir site."
2019,"The weir was operational with enumeration beginning on June 30 and ending on August 2. Smoke from a nearby wildlife interrupted weir operations for six hours on July 13. Enumeration was suspended between midnight and 5:59am, with normal weir operation resuming at 6:00am. The door on the trap of the weir was left open during the 6-hour interruption to allow for salmon and other resident fish species to migrate freely up and down river. The partially enumerated day of July 13 was adjusted to a full day count using linear interpolation as outlined in the methods sections of the annual report"
2020,The weir was not installed nor operated due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
