1994,Location,"The EF Andreafsky River weir was originally installed at latitude 62.12996° and longitude -162.79793 (WGS84 datum; Tobin and Harp 1995), approximately 40 km upstream from the confluence with the main stem."
1995,Location,"Weir moved about 2 km downstream, at latitude 62.11673 and longitude -162.80761, which had a wider and shallower
channel profile thought to be better able to handle high flow periods (Tobin and Harper 1996; Mears and Morella 2017)."
1996,Design,Second fish passage chute added (Tobin and Harper 1997).
"1994, 2006 to 2016",Duration,"Count stop dates ranged from July 27 to August 3, based on diminishing counts of Chinook and summer Chum Salmon."
1995 to 2005,Duration,Effort to count later arriving Coho Salmon and the weir remained operational until a fall stop date that ranged from September 11 to September 23.
Before 2014,Counting Method ,An observer sat on the chute counting fish from above whenever the doors on the chute were open.
Since 2014,Counting Method ,"Motion activated, high resolution video systems were
developed and since that time fish have been counted by observing video images of migrating
fish (Mears 2015)."
Early Years,Sample Size,"In the early years of the EF Andreafsky (Tobin and Harper 1996), there was an effort to achieve weekly sampling goals during a 1–4 day period at the start of each weekly stratum to maximize demographic contrasts among strata, a strategy discussed by Geiger et al. (1990)."
Later Years,Sample Size,"Later, the weir project adopted a daily sampling plan with effort distributed across different hourly time periods each day (Mears and Morella 2017). To ensure sampling was distributed throughout the run roughly in proportion to escapement, the season was divided into 4 periods having approximately equal fish passage numbers based on historical fish passage counts. The sample target was 55 – 60 fish of each species within each period. The same size goal for each species was 220-240 fish for the season. This goal was based on a statistical calculation indicating a minimum desirable sample size of 180 fish with readable scales (Contiz 2019)."
Recent,Biological Sampling,A recent problem in biological sampling at the EF Andreafsky River weir is the increasing frequency of high water temperatures (see next table).
