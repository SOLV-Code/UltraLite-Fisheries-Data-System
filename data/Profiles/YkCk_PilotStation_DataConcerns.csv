1980-1994,"Prior to 1993, the project  used dual-beam sonar equipment that operated at 420 kHz. Prior to 1995, the project attempted to identify direction of travel of detected targets by aiming transducers at an upstream or downstream oblique angle relative to fish travel. Because of these changes, data collected from 1995 to current are not directly compatible to previous years."
Mid 1990s,Sandbar issue on the right bank plagued the project for several years. Detection through the silt band created by the bar while depositing or vacating made counts difficult in those years.
1996,The Pilot Station sonar project did not operate at full capacity in 1996 and there are no passage estimates for this year.
2001,"High water levels were experienced at Pilot Station therefore, passage estimates are considered conservative. Extreme high water during the bulk of the summer season (May, all of June and part of July).  Water remained  slightly above average throughout the fall."
2005,"Estimates include extrapolations for the dates June 10 to June 18 to account for the time before the DIDSON was deployed. Otherwise, the estimates should be good."
2009,"High water levels were experienced at Pilot Station therefore which limited detection. Passage estimates are considered conservative. Extremely high in May but then just above average the rest of the summer season. In the fall, water dropped to record low causing all kinds of unique issues for those species."
