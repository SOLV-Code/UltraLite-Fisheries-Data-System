2014,"Large inseason data gap: No data was collected on RB from July 4 to July 13 due to a command module error.  Post season, a linear relationship developed from cumulative right bank counts was used to estimate missed passage during this time (more details in final report).  Using a linear relationship meant the number of fish estimate per day was consistent, and did not increase with time. As further years of Porcupine sonar counts have shown, the Porcupine cumulative run does not always follow a sigmoid shaped curve, as projects with more strongly unimodal (daily count) passage. Additionally, the missing time period being at the beginning of the run when passage would be lower, suggest that a linear estimate is a conservative measure that is sufficient for estimating a small amount of missed passage. "
2015,"Crossover date: As well as different methods used to select crossover date between years, in 2015 the reported values for Chinook and fall chum during the crossover period are different. From Aug 5 to Aug 17 EDI reported 235 Chinook (EDI 2016, Table 9) and DFO 377 (MacDonald et al. 2016b, Table 1)."
2016,"Large inseason data gap: No data was collected on left bank from the evening of July 8 to mid-day July 12 due to a command module fault. After this point, the command module was alternated between banks, switched around 12 pm each day. For the almost four days of no left bank counts, missing data was estimated from average of counts before and after the gap for a daily passage rate. From July 12 – July 17 when the command module was switched between banks so only single day gaps existed, linear interpolation of the missing day was completed using the day before and day after counts (Ben Snow, 2020, personal communication)."
2017,"Environmental conditions for the Chinook run in 2017 were abnormal. Although sonar operations went well, severe low water levels and high water temperatures likely contributed to low observed passage, including potential for pre-spawn mortality and thermal barriers to migration. It is possible Chinook salmon migrated outside of the sonar range, however this occurring in substantial numbers seems unlikely given bank orientation and netting catches. It is also possible delayed migration occurred and more Chinook salmon passed than the end of season expansion estimates, however test fishery catches did not reflect this. "
