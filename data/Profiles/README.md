# data/Profiles

This folder includes:

*  a project inventory that matches individual assessment projects to stocks, watersheds, plot labels etc. (*ProjectInfo_Lookup.csv*)
* For each project, have up to 3 files: Need a data file for each project, and if there's any relevant information also have a file with data concerns, and a file with operational changes. Each of these has a specific format that needs to be exactly preserved, so that data can be merged automatically across projects.

THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE OR UP-TO-DATE DATASET FOR YUKON CHINOOK!** These files are used to illustrate the real-life level of detail that was compiled to document the context for each time series.
