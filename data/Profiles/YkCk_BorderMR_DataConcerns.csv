Years_Affected,Potential_Issue
1973 and 1974,Fishwheel locations and recapture methods not comparable to 1983 and on. 
1984,No fishwheel program. Border passage estimate based on mainstem harvest plus 5-area escapement index relationship. 
1988,Extremely high water and debris affected start date of fishwheel catches and commercial recapture fishery at the early part of the run. 
1992,"Only one fishwheel (White Rock) was in operation for most of the Chinook season, with Sheep Rock not running until August 8 (affecting number of tags applied). "
2002,"In 2002, the distribution of the run only allowed an SPAS estimate to be calculated for part of the season, so an expansion was applied based on mean run timing for 2000-2001 and 2003-2005. "
2007,Very limited Chinook catch and tag recovery data after the first week of August affected recaptures avalible for estimate. 
2008,"Low run size created challenges with implementing full suite of test fishing. Non-stratified estimate used, but flagged as likely biased low at the time. Stratified SPAS estimate not completed. "
