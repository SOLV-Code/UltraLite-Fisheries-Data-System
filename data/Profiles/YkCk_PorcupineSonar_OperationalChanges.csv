2010,All ,Pilot program / feasibility test. 
2011-2013,All,Fall chum sonar program operated by VGG and a consultant. Sonar was transitioned from split-beam (EK60) systems to ARIS 1200 in 2013 (all split beam from 2009-2012).
2014,All ,"Season extended to include Chinook run, project undertaken by VGG and a consultant. VGG and DFO undertake the fall chum sonar. "
2014,Sonar,"Both bank sonar ARIS 1200 (long range) units. Operated at full range (80 m), continuously recording, files saved in one hour segments. "
2014,Test Fishery ,"Drift fishery using 5, 5.25, 6.5, and 7.5 nets, each 100 feet long and a depth of 29 meshes. All hung at 2:1 ratio. Nets were all intended to be 12 feet / 3.65 m deep, so the 6.5 and 7.5 mesh nets were deeper than was practical for drifting, and the 5.25 was used ~ 60% of the time.  Roughly 48 drift netting hours captured one Chinook salmon and no other species. "
2014,Crossover ,"The Chinook program (VGG and consultant) estimated a decrease in Chinook passage after the last day of sonar counts based on the average decrease from the last week of counts applied to the last day of counts. The same was calculated for the chum program which started after a two day gap in operations, subtracting the early estimated chum counts from the Chinook sonar counts. The chum program estimated different dates for a cross over period and determined a hard date on which all estimates were called fall chum. These methods produced final totals within a range of 259 fish. "
2014-2017,Sonar ,"Management of missing data; short windows of missing passage. Interpreted manually as the average passage during the equivalent time on either side of the gap, or estimated from the daily average passage.  Management of missing data; long windows of missing passage. Generally manually estimated from linear relationship between banks when one sonar remained operational.  See annual reports for specific yearly methods of estimating counts during downtime. "
2015,Test Fishery ,"The primary method of captured changed to a set net test fishery for Chinook, due to level of effort required drifting compared to passage numbers. Set nets were 6.75 and 7.5 inch mesh.. Over approximately 225 set net hours, 25 Chinook, one fall chum, two broad whitefish and one burbot were captured. Drift netting was also undertaken July 22 - August 1 with the intent of capturing the early fall chum. Mesh sizes were 5.75, 6, 6.75 and 7.5 inch mesh. Nearly 8 hours of drift netting effort captured one fall chum and no other species. All nets dimensions 100 ft long, mesh depths equivalent to 10-12 feet and hang ratio of 3:1.  "
2016,Sonar ,"In season daily recounts of four randomly selected files per bank for QA/QC, by a second reviewer who did not count the original file. Qualitative review of 12 hours of data per week also done by DFO in season. Prior to this, quality control checks done by biologists post season. "
2016,Sonar,Sonar units set to alternate every half hour between a 0-25 m high frequency viewing window (inshore) and 25-50 m low frequency viewing window (offshore). Reduction in range based on previous years evidence of bank orientation.  Hourly counts created by doubling the inshore and offshore counts for each bank.  
2016,Test Fishery ,"Set net test fishery for Chinook mesh sizes was undertaken rotating nets of 5.25, 6.75, 7.5 and 8.5 inch mesh sizes. Nearly 130 hours of set net effort captured 74 Chinook, one burbot, two lake whitefish, and no fall chum. Drift netting was conducted towards the end of the Chinook tun, to target early chum salmon primarily using a 5.25 inch net (3 drifts with a 6.75"" net) and undertook onshore drifts only.  Nearly 4 hours of drift netting effort captured three fall chum and one inconnu. All nets dimensions 100 ft long, mesh depths equivalent to 10-12 feet and hang ratio of 3:1.  "
2016,ASL,"Started collecting ASL (salmon) and length (freshwater fish) from community harvest on a voluntary basis, to supplement test fishery data opportunistically. "
2016,Crossover,"A high water event necessitated removing the sonar units from the river from August 12 - August 21/22. August 12 was also the last Chinook capture and the first chum capture in the test fishery, and a post season estimate from August 12 was calculated with a second order polynomial equation. The same was done for the start of the fall chum run which resulted in the subtraction of an estimated three fall chum from the Chinook count. "
2017,All,Chinook and fall chum programs combined and run by DFO and VGG.
2017,Sonar,Sonar units set to alternate every half hour between a 0-20 m high frequency viewing window (inshore) and 20-40 m low frequency viewing window (offshore). Reduction in range based on previous years evidence of bank orientation.  Hourly counts created by doubling the inshore and offshore counts for each bank.  
2017,Test Fishery,"Set net test fishery for Chinook mesh sizes 4.5, 5.25, 6.75, 7.5, and 8.5 (addition of 4.5 mesh size to previous years). Set nets were rotated through these sizes as well as within 10 and 15 foot hanging depths. Set nets were 50 feet long and hunt at a 3:1 ratio. Set netting effort of 173 hours captured eight Chinook, two fall chum, two broad whitefish, and one sucker. Drift net rotation composed of 5.25 and 78.5 inch mesh, hang depth of 6 and 8 feet, and lengths of 100 feet, with hang ratio of 3:1. Drift netting did not take place during the Chinook operational period, however no Chinook were caught in the chum operational drift netting effort of 20 hours. "
2017,Crossover ,"Based on the first chum capture in the test fishery August 4, sonar counts were presumed to be chum starting August 5. A second order polynomial was used to estimate Chinook passage from August 5 - 10. Post season Chinook and pre-season chum expansions counts for individual days were not subtracted from actual sonar counts, but used as an estimate of additional passage. "
2017,Sonar,"Beginning in 2017, additional statistics around the sonar count have been calculated; Average Percent Error (repeatability of a count between individuals) using the APE equation from Chilton and Beamish 1982. Variance calculated using method from McDougall and Lozori 2018. Confidence intervals calculated based on APE and variance (Cronkite et al. 2006). "
2018,Sonar,"Started collecting ASL (salmon) and length (freshwater fish) from community harvest on a voluntary basis, to supplement test fishery data opportunistically."
2018,Crossover ,"Due to a high water event, LB sonar was not operational from Aug 16 to Sept 6 and RB sonar was not operational Aug 16 to Aug 27. To estimate Chinook passage a linear equation based on the previous five days of sonar counts was used to select August 18 as the last date of Chinook passage, and a quadratic equation (Crane and Dunbar 2011, Equation 1) was used to create an end of season expansion (adding 33 Chinook).  "
2019,Sonar,"Introduction of R program to collect and manage enumeration data, automating the collection, entry, and estimation of hourly passage. Missing data estimated using structural models and Kalman smoothing (Milligan et al. 2020). "
2019,Sonar,Estimates of total length from sonar targets (fish) measured using Echotastic Software for a subset of fish. 
2019,Crossover ,"The crossover date was determined as the midpoint between the last in season Chinook test fishery catch and the first chum catch. This was supported by sonar target length measurements, and bank choice (left bank dominant). No overlap was calculated (hard transition). "
