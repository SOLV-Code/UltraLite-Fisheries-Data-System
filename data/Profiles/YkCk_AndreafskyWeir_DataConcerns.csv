2001,"Missing about half of the annual passage because high water prevented
counting until July 15 (Zabkar and Harper 2003). However, the 2001 escapements of Chinook and Chum Salmon into the EF Andreafsky River have been reconstructed for production analyses by Siegel (2017) and Fleischman and Evenson (2010)."
2019,"Biological sampling was temporarily suspended 2019 as mandated by current protocol when water temperatures exceeded specified thresholds identified by the Environmental Protection Agency (17 C for three consecutive days or any time water temperature measurement 20 C°; Shink 2020). This protocol was established in an effort to minimize the cumulative impact of handling/sampling and heat stress on adult salmon preparing to spawn. Due to persistent high water temperatures exceeding thresholds for safe fish handling no sampling was conducted for two weeks (July 7–20) in 2019. As a result, biological sample sizes were not only below target ranges, but were not distributed in proportion to the roughly equal passage numbers in each of the 4 periods."
