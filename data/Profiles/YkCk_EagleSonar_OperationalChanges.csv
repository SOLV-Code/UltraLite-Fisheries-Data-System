2003-2004,All,Project Feasibility
2005,Duration,Project operated only during Chinook salmon migration from July 1 -August 13.
2005,Sonar,"Kongsberg Simrad EK60 digital echo sounder which included a general-purpose transceiver and a 4° by 10° 120 kHz transducer (left bank). DIDSON long-range unit manufactured by Sound Metrics Corp. operated at 0.70 MHz (right bank). Sampled 3 strata: single left bank strata ( 60 min sampling duration); right bank nearshore 1-20 m (30 min sampling duration), and right bank offshore 20-40 m (30 min sampling duration)."
2005,Test Fishery,"6 Mesh sizes utilized in the drift gillnet fishery 2.75 in (70 mm), 4.0 in (102 mm), 5.25 in (133 mm), 6.5 in (165 mm), 7.5 in (191mm), and 8.5 in (216 mm).
 6.5-inch mesh gillnet was set from shore on August 4 for 48 hours to explore the possibility of using set nets at the site in future."
2006,Duration,Project ran full season from July 8 to October 6.   
2006,Sonar,"The range of the left bank split beam sonar was reduced on Aug 18 from 150 m to 75 m to allow faster ping rates and improved detection of chum salmon nearshore. From September 8 to October 4 a DIDSON long-range unit was operated side-by-side with the split-beam sonar on the left bank. The purpose was to collect data to examine whether small, non-salmon species were misclassified as salmon on the split-beam echogram. Inseason cutoff date for Chinook salmon was determined using sonar data, gillnet catches, local subsistence harvest, and Canadian mark–recapture fish wheel estimates. "
2006,Test Fishery,"Four different mesh sizes were drifted over the course of the season: 7.5 in (191 mm), 5.25 in (133 mm), 4.0 in (102 mm), and 2.75 in (70 mm).  In addition to the standard drifts, the 2.75 in (70 mm) , 4.0 in (102 mm), and 5.25 in (133 mm) nets were used to investigate the presence of fish close to shore (shore to the inshore extent of the nearshore drift). On the days that the 2.75 in and 4.0 in nets were used, they were also drifted once within the nearshore zone. The inshore drifts were referred to as “beach walks”. Two set gillnets of mesh sizes 7.5 in (191 mm) and 5.75 in (147 mm) were fished periodically throughout the season. The nets were 25 fm in length and approximately 3-fm deep. The setnet site was approximately 100 meters upstream from the split-beam sonar on the left bank."
2007,Sonar,"July 31 to August 9, 2007, DIDSON long-range unit was operated side-by-side with the split-beam sonar on the left bank. Inseason cutoff date for Chinook salmon was determined using reverse-cumulative Chinook catches and cumulative chum catches."
2007,Test Fishery,"Test fishing for species composition was conducted once daily on the left bank. During the sampling period, both the 5.25 in (5.75 in for the inshore) and the 7.5-in nets were drifted twice within each of 3 zones (inshore, nearshore and offshore). An additional fishing period was conducted once daily between July 9 and August 15 after the normal test fishing period, Three different mesh sizes (6.5 in, 7.5 in and 8.5 in) were fished daily over the course of the Chinook salmon run to effectively capture all size classes present."
2008,All,5.75 inch mesh was discontinued from the species composition test fishery (The 5.75 net was replaced with a 5.25 net. 5.75 was only used because a 5.25 couldn’t be purchased for the inshore drift in 2007). Non salmon study using side by side comparison of split beam and DIDSON sonars on left bank discontinued.
2009-2012,All,Sonar methodology consistent with 2008. Around 2010 the driftnetting switched from drifting through the beam for the inshore and offshore LB sets to drifting below the sonar. Prior to this fish could have been captured above the sonar and released below the sonar.
2013,All,"CPUE from the species composition test fishery replaced the methodology of
using reverse cumulative of chinook and fall chum salmon catch to determine
inseason cut-off date for Chinook salmon."
2014,All,"Left bank split-beam sampling range was divided into 2 strata (30 min sampling duration) during the Chinook migration to increase the number of echoes received by fish
traveling closer to the transducer (S1 0-50 m and S2 50-150 m). The use of Excel to calculate daily passage was eliminated, and passage
estimation was calculated using an R script."
2015,All,"Replaced DIDSON with ARIS sonar. Split-beam sampling range was divided into 2 strata ( 30 min sampling duration) during the fall chum migration to increase the number of echoes received by fish
traveling closer to the transducer (S3: approximately 0–25 m and S4: approximately 25–75 m)"
2016-2020,All,Methodology consistent with 2015.
