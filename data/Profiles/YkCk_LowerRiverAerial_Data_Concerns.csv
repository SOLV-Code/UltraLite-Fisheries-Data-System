Andreafsky East Fork Aerial,All,Survey reaches are not standardized. 
Andreafsky East Fork Aerial,"1969, 1970, 1980, 1984, 2000, and 2015",Use designation differs from JTC reporting 
Andreafsky East Fork Aerial,1970,“Fair” survey rating was overturned based on “poor” survey comments. 
Andreafsky East Fork Aerial,1974,A reconnaissance survey was flown on July 4 and 50 Chinook were observed. No follow-up peak survey was flown. 
Andreafsky East Fork Aerial,1992,"Multiple surveys were flown. Peak survey count of 1,030 on July 17 was rated as poor and incomplete (75% of survey area flown). A follow-up survey on July 29 was rated fair, comments indicated the survey was past peak, and the count of 756 Chinook salmon was not used."
Andreafsky East Fork Aerial,1997,"Survey reach description says “East Fork”; however, survey comments reference Allen Creek which is West Fork. Assigned the counts to East Fork to be consistent with JTC reporting."
Andreafsky West Fork Aerial,"1969, 1975, 1988, 2000, 2007, and 2015",Use designation differs from JTC reporting 
Andreafsky West Fork Aerial,"1975, 1992",AYKDBMS total count differs from JTC reporting
Andreafsky West Fork Aerial,1970,“Fair” survey rating was overturned based on “poor” survey comments. 
Andreafsky West Fork Aerial,1975,Multiple surveys were flown. Peak survey count of 301 on July 22 was rated as poor. A follow-up survey on July 26 was rated good but only 120 Chinook were observed. The smaller count was used but is consistent with JTC reporting. 
Andreafsky West Fork Aerial,1984,Standardized count differs from JTC reporting. A total of 5 fish observed in an unnamed tributary (not normally surveyed) was excluded from the total count to improve comparability with other years.
Andreafsky West Fork Aerial,1987,Standardized count differs from JTC reporting. A total of 140 fish observed in Allen Creek (not normally surveyed) was excluded from the total count to improve comparability with other years.
Andreafsky West Fork Aerial,1988,Only 60 river miles were flown. 
Anvik Aerial,"1973, 1993, 2000, 2006, 2018",Use designation differs from JTC reporting 
Anvik Aerial,"1975 to 1979, 1985, 1987, 2000, 2007, 2013",AYKDBMS total count differs from JTC reporting 
Anvik Aerial,"1983, 1991, 1996, 2000, 2006",AYKDBMS mainstem index count differs from JTC 
Anvik Aerial,1967,poor survey rating based on observer comments.
Anvik Aerial,1972 to 1979,Anvik tower counts are included in the air survey portion of the AYKDBMS. JTC reporting appear to have incorrectly summed tower and air survey counts in a subset of years.
Anvik Aerial,1978,"Multiple survey dates (July 11 – July 15) effectively covered the full standardized area and mainstem index area. Daily survey extents overlapped, and it was not possible to ensure fish were not double counted. The sum from all days and survey areas was 198 Chinook salmon. "
Anvik Aerial,1981,Poor survey based on observer comments.
Anvik Aerial,1983,Section 106 was not flown. Mainstem index count (376) reported by JTC is incomplete.
Anvik Aerial,????,Observer comments “good” conditions above Yellow River overrides undefined survey rating.
Anvik Aerial,1993,"Rating is undefined, and comments indicate “fair” or “poor”. JTC reports count as usable."
Anvik Aerial,1996,JTC mainstem index count incorrectly included reaches 101 and 102
Anvik Aerial,2000,Original survey form is missing. No detail regarding spatial extent of survey.
Anvik Aerial,2006,Mainstem index reported by JTC includes approximately 8 miles of counts from section 103. Reported counts cannot be parsed to develop a comparable index. 
Anvik Aerial,2008,Survey rating listed as “Surveyed too early”. Recommendation not to use count is consistent with JTC reporting.
Nulato Aerial Both Forks,1974,"Survey rated as “fair”, but comment includes “counts considered 25% low” likely due to early survey timing of July 13."
Nulato Aerial Both Forks,1983,Good survey rating as per comments.
Nulato Aerial Both Forks,"2004, 2005","North Fork count excludes section 101 which was flown but grouped with South Fork count and cannot be parsed. Likely 5% of total Nulato annual survey is misallocated between forks, based on average contribution of North Fork reach 101. "
Nulato Aerial Both Forks,2012,Helicopter survey
Nulato Aerial North Fork,1991,Survey was conducted over a two-day period with no overlap in survey areas.
Nulato Aerial South Fork,1981,Use designation differs from JTC reporting 
Nulato Aerial South Fork,1985,Survey description of “South Fork Drill Hole to 15 miles upstream” suggests most of the standardized area was flown
Gisasa Aerial,All,Survey reaches are not standardized.
Gisasa Aerial,1994,"Two surveys were flown. The 8/10/94 survey counted 2,888 fish but no survey rating was given. The 7/26/94 survey counted fewer fish (2,775) but was rated “fair”. The rated survey should be used."
Gisasa Aerial,2001,Use designation differs from JTC reporting
Gisasa Aerial,2013,Poor survey based on comment “Surveyed too late”.
TozitnaAerial,2008,survey focused on counting redds not live salmon
TozitnaAerial,2009,includes unknown count upriver from survey area
