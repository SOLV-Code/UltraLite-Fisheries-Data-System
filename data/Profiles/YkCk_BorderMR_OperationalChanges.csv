1973,All,"One fishwheel   48km downstream from Dawson City. Basic fish wheel construction. Petersen disc tags were placed behind the dorsal fin as a mark. A range of recapture events used including four locations with multipanel gillnets, a subset of commercial fishwheels, commerical gillnets, and First Nation fish camps. Only fish captured upstream of Dawson were used in the mark-recapture estimation.  Data not used, considered preliminary work. Details in Sweitzer (1974)."
1974,All,"Similar methods to 1973, with the addtion of spaghetti tags to roughly one third of salmon and Peterson discs to the rest. Recapture data from commercial, domestic, and First Nation fisheries. Initially recapture data focused on fisheries above the Stewart River,  but was recalculated to focus on the Dawson area (Milligan et al. 1985). Data not used, considered preliminary work. Details in Brock (1976)."
1982 to 1983,All,"Fishwheel MR study focused on border passage. Multiple fishwheels and locations. In 1982: fishwheels 7 and 12 river km upstream from the border, in 1983: in locations 12, 15, and 89 km above border. Tagging with spaghetti tags and recaptures in all fisheries, but commercial fishery below Stewart used for estimates as it had the most reliable information. 1983 included radio tagging to estimate tag loss and spawnig  distribution. Radio tagging also done at commercial fishwheel 142km above border. Study observed erratic post-tagging behaviour, proximity to spawning ground, handling and holding effects, vulnerability to recapture (possibly related to stress, proximity to fishery) and effect of water level. "
1984,All,"No mark-recapture program. See ""Data Issues"" table for alternate estimate description."
1985,Location,"Program resumed. 3 fishwheel locations; 10 km (White Rock), 13 km (Moose Rock), and 17 km (Sheep Rock) upstream of the border – this is an overlap of locations with earlier years (differences in river distance measurement methods).  "
1994-1995,Tagging,Only Chinook salmon over 450 mm in fork length were tagged at the fishwheels. Likely small effect as minimal fish under 450 mm caught. 
"2000, 2007 and 2008",Recapture Fishery,Test Fishery only. Low run size and limited to no commercial fishing oppurtunies led to a test fishery in the Dawson area taking place to serve as the recapture event. 
"1998, 2001-2004",Recapture Fishery,Commercial fishery and test fishery.
1999-2002,Tag Loss,"Investigation of tag loss, looking for secondary marks . No fish with only secondary mark found in subset of fish examined in upstream fisheries. "
1999-2007,Population Size Calculation,"Temporally stratified analysis (SPAS, Arnason et al. 1996) undertaken retrospectively for 1999-2007 to produce final published estimates for the JTC report and this dataset. "
2008,Population Size Calculation,"As the primary in-season and post-season assessment was switched to the Eagle Sonar, the estimate produced from this project in 2008 was never updated from the preliminary estimate using standard one event mark recapture. "
2001,Fishwheel construction,"Fishwheel pontoons were upgraded to aluminium floats, with an undetermined effect on fish catchability. "
2004,Marking Event,"Gillnetting was undertaken from around the second week of July to the first week of August to increase Chinook captures. Nets were fished in three locations on river left, in four combinations as follows: (1) Mesh size 5.5”, length 120 feet, 30 meshes deep, 2.5:1 hang ratio, (2) Mesh size 5.5”, length 150 feet, 35 meshes deep, 4:1 hang ratio, (3)	Mesh size 7.25”, length 120 feet, 30 meshes deep, 4:1 hang ratio, (4) Nets #1 and #3 together. The first three individual nets were only used briefly at the beginning, followed by the combined net. Soak time was generally between one and three hours. In total, 139 Chinook were captured (135 tagged, 87% were male).   "
2008,All,"Final year of fish wheel operation, as JTC recommended using the Eagle sonar project in 2008 as the primary assessment tool for the border passage estimate. Was going to operate in 2009 for another comparative year of data, but flood damaged."
2010-2012,ASL Collection,"One fishwheel (White Rock, 10 rkm from border) operated as an R and E project to collect ASL and  genetic data from Chinook for the purpose of comparision with Eagle test fishery. "
