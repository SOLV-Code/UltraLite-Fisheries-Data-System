counting until July 15 (Zabkar and Harper 2003). However, the 2001 escapements of Chinook and Chum Salmon into the EF Andreafsky River have been reconstructed for production analyses by Siegel (2017) and Fleischman and Evenson (2010)."
"Lower","Tributary","Weir","Andreafsky","AndreafskyWeir","2019","Biological sampling was temporarily suspended 2019 as mandated by current protocol when water temperatures exceeded specified thresholds identified by the Environmental Protection Agency (17 C for three consecutive days or any time water temperature measurement 20 C°; Shink 2020). This protocol was established in an effort to minimize the cumulative impact of handling/sampling and heat stress on adult salmon preparing to spawn. Due to persistent high water temperatures exceeding thresholds for safe fish handling no sampling was conducted for two weeks (July 7–20) in 2019. As a result, biological sample sizes were not only below target ranges, but were not distributed in proportion to the roughly equal passage numbers in each of the 4 periods."

"Middle","Tributary","Weir","Koyukuk","HenshawWeir","2000, 2003","The weir was only operational for part of the season due to high water for most of the season, which caused the counting schedule to be interrupted at times.  On occasions when water level rose high enough to impede the counting schedule the weir remained intact but weir panels were submerged allowing fish to pass undetected."
"Middle","Tributary","Weir","Koyukuk","HenshawWeir","2006","The first summer chum salmon was counted on June 30.  Daily escapement counts, hydrological and weather information were reported seven days a week by satellite phone to the FFWFO.  Due to heavy rains, the Henshaw Creek weir flooded on July 1 and remained flooded for the rest of the field season.  By July 27, the water level had dropped sufficiently to remove the weir.  "
"Middle","Tributary","Weir","Koyukuk","HenshawWeir","2007","The first Chinook and summer chum salmon were counted on July 2.    Due to heavy rains, the Henshaw Creek weir flooded on July 16 through 1430 on July 21 and again on August 6.  The preliminary escapement count was 569 Chinook salmon, and 32,085 summer chum salmon. Missed counts were interpolated postseason and annual estimate updated."
"Middle","Tributary","Weir","Koyukuk","HenshawWeir","2010","The weir was operational beginning on June 23 and ending August 8. Two interruptions to weir operations occurred due to high water events: July 7 – 9 and July 22. Daily estimates of Chinook and summer chum salmon passage were estimated for the days that were missed due to high water by using linear interpolation as outlined in the methods section of the annual report."
"Middle","Tributary","Weir","Koyukuk","HenshawWeir","2013","The weir was operational beginning on June 30 and ending on August 5. One high water event interrupted weir operations and suspended enumeration efforts for nearly four and a half days, beginning at 22:45 hours on July 9 and ending at 12:00 hours on July 14. The partially enumerated days of July 9 and 14 were adjusted to provide full day passage estimates. However, no interpolation was made to estimate the passage for the complete missed days, July 10 – 13. No interpolation was made due to the timing of the high water event coupled with the size of the escapement on July 9 and July 14. The first day of escapement for both species was July 9. Estimated escapement on July 9 was one Chinook salmon and 42,528 chum salmon. During the period of interruption, the trap door on the weir was left closed, blocking passage of salmon for 3.5 days of the 4.5 day period. The trap door was opened to allow for unimpeded migration for the last 24 hours of the 4.5 day period. While the trap door was closed, it is assumed that the majority of both salmon species were unable to migrate upstream of the weir. However, it is possible that a portion of both salmon species were able to migrate over the weir as the weir was underwater during this high water event.   "
"Middle","Tributary","Weir","Koyukuk","HenshawWeir","2014","The weir was not installed nor operated due to sustained flooding in Henshaw Creek. High water persisted from mid-June through July 29, at which point in time the decision was made to forgo weir installation as the majority of the run had already passed through the weir site."
"Middle","Tributary","Weir","Koyukuk","HenshawWeir","2016","Two high water events interrupted weir operations. The first high water event occurred between 09:00 hours on July 5 and 23:59 hours on July 8. This event temporarily suspended ASL sampling, but did not suspend escapement enumeration. The second high water event occurred between 19:30 and 22:00 hours on July 11. This event suspended escapement enumeration. The trap door was left open during this event as to not block passage through the weir. The partially enumerated day of July 11 was adjusted to a full day count using linear interpolation as outlined in the methods sections of the annual report."

"Middle","Tributary","Weir","Koyukuk","HenshawWeir","2019","The weir was operational with enumeration beginning on June 30 and ending on August 2. Smoke from a nearby wildlife interrupted weir operations for six hours on July 13. Enumeration was suspended between midnight and 5:59am, with normal weir operation resuming at 6:00am. The door on the trap of the weir was left open during the 6-hour interruption to allow for salmon and other resident fish species to migrate freely up and down river. The partially enumerated day of July 13 was adjusted to a full day count using linear interpolation as outlined in the methods sections of the annual report"

"All","Mainstem","Sonar","Mainstem","PilotStation","1980-1994","Prior to 1993, the project  used dual-beam sonar equipment that operated at 420 kHz. Prior to 1995, the project attempted to identify direction of travel of detected targets by aiming transducers at an upstream or downstream oblique angle relative to fish travel. Because of these changes, data collected from 1995 to current are not directly compatible to previous years."
"All","Mainstem","Sonar","Mainstem","PilotStation","Mid 1990s","Sandbar issue on the right bank plagued the project for several years. Detection through the silt band created by the bar while depositing or vacating made counts difficult in those years."
"All","Mainstem","Sonar","Mainstem","PilotStation","1996","The Pilot Station sonar project did not operate at full capacity in 1996 and there are no passage estimates for this year."
"All","Mainstem","Sonar","Mainstem","PilotStation","2001","High water levels were experienced at Pilot Station therefore, passage estimates are considered conservative. Extreme high water during the bulk of the summer season (May, all of June and part of July).  Water remained  slightly above average throughout the fall."
"All","Mainstem","Sonar","Mainstem","PilotStation","2005","Estimates include extrapolations for the dates June 10 to June 18 to account for the time before the DIDSON was deployed. Otherwise, the estimates should be good."
"All","Mainstem","Sonar","Mainstem","PilotStation","2009","High water levels were experienced at Pilot Station therefore which limited detection. Passage estimates are considered conservative. Extremely high in May but then just above average the rest of the summer season. In the fall, water dropped to record low causing all kinds of unique issues for those species."
"Canada","Porcupine","Sonar","Porcupine","PorcupineSonar","2014","Large inseason data gap: No data was collected on RB from July 4 to July 13 due to a command module error.  Post season, a linear relationship developed from cumulative right bank counts was used to estimate missed passage during this time (more details in final report).  Using a linear relationship meant the number of fish estimate per day was consistent, and did not increase with time. As further years of Porcupine sonar counts have shown, the Porcupine cumulative run does not always follow a sigmoid shaped curve, as projects with more strongly unimodal (daily count) passage. Additionally, the missing time period being at the beginning of the run when passage would be lower, suggest that a linear estimate is a conservative measure that is sufficient for estimating a small amount of missed passage. "
"Canada","Porcupine","Sonar","Porcupine","PorcupineSonar","2015","Crossover date: As well as different methods used to select crossover date between years, in 2015 the reported values for Chinook and fall chum during the crossover period are different. From Aug 5 to Aug 17 EDI reported 235 Chinook (EDI 2016, Table 9) and DFO 377 (MacDonald et al. 2016b, Table 1)."
"Canada","Porcupine","Sonar","Porcupine","PorcupineSonar","2016","Large inseason data gap: No data was collected on left bank from the evening of July 8 to mid-day July 12 due to a command module fault. After this point, the command module was alternated between banks, switched around 12 pm each day. For the almost four days of no left bank counts, missing data was estimated from average of counts before and after the gap for a daily passage rate. From July 12 – July 17 when the command module was switched between banks so only single day gaps existed, linear interpolation of the missing day was completed using the day before and day after counts (Ben Snow, 2020, personal communication)."
"Canada","Porcupine","Sonar","Porcupine","PorcupineSonar","2017","Environmental conditions for the Chinook run in 2017 were abnormal. Although sonar operations went well, severe low water levels and high water temperatures likely contributed to low observed passage, including potential for pre-spawn mortality and thermal barriers to migration. It is possible Chinook salmon migrated outside of the sonar range, however this occurring in substantial numbers seems unlikely given bank orientation and netting catches. It is also possible delayed migration occurred and more Chinook salmon passed than the end of season expansion estimates, however test fishery catches did not reflect this. "
