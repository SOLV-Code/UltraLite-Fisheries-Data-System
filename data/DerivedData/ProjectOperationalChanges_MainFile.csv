"Lower","Tributary","Weir","Andreafsky","AndreafskyWeir","Early Years","Sample Size","In the early years of the EF Andreafsky (Tobin and Harper 1996), there was an effort to achieve weekly sampling goals during a 1–4 day period at the start of each weekly stratum to maximize demographic contrasts among strata, a strategy discussed by Geiger et al. (1990)."
"Lower","Tributary","Weir","Andreafsky","AndreafskyWeir","Later Years","Sample Size","Later, the weir project adopted a daily sampling plan with effort distributed across different hourly time periods each day (Mears and Morella 2017). To ensure sampling was distributed throughout the run roughly in proportion to escapement, the season was divided into 4 periods having approximately equal fish passage numbers based on historical fish passage counts. The sample target was 55 – 60 fish of each species within each period. The same size goal for each species was 220-240 fish for the season. This goal was based on a statistical calculation indicating a minimum desirable sample size of 180 fish with readable scales (Contiz 2019)."
