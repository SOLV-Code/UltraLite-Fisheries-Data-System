## Overview

This is a very basic illustration of the kind of automated reports you can generate with R markdown. In this set-up, you have limited options for formatting (e.g., page breaks or figure captions require workarounds), but it shows the key benefit: every time you source data is updated you can quickly generate an updated report with all the  updated figures and tables. 

This document was generated following the steps from this [worked example](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html). For an in-depth description of many possibilities for markdown reports (pdf, html, word, powerpoint), start with [this guide](https://epirhandbook.com/en/reports-with-r-markdown.html). For a properly formatted technical report, consider the versatile [bookdown package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) or the  [csasdown extension ](https://github.com/pbs-assess/csasdown) specifically for DFO technical reports and research documents.

*Important*: It is easy to get lost in the beautiful intricacies of generating perfectly-formatted reports using these more powerful tools for generating reports from markdown. However, the real bottleneck is getting a streamlined workflow up and running, from the individual data contributors to a basic summary of available information. Until that step works smoothly, a very basic report like this example should be sufficient. All the packages you need are already part of your RStudio install, so no additional setup is required.  *Don't procrastinate on the hard part by spending your time on the flashy stuff!*


## Example of Automated Summary Text

*The values in the text below are calculated from the data summaries and update automatically when the source data changes*


The current data set covers `r length(unique(summary.df$Project))` assessment projects. Survey types include `r paste(sort(unique(summary.df$SurveyType)),collapse = ", ")`. The earliest record is from `r min(summary.df$FirstYr)`.


## Example of A Summary Plot


![](PLOTS/DataOverview_ALL.png)

**Figure 1:** Overview of available data. For each assessment project, the timeline shows available estimates, categorized into three types: records for which uncertainty has been quantified (i.e., a coefficient of variation, CV, is available as well), records for which only a point estimate is available, and records that have been excluded due to data quality concerns (e.g., poor visibility during aerial survey).


## Another Example of A Summary Plot


![](PLOTS/RankingPlot_ALL.png)

**Figure 2:** Comparison of abundance estimates across project. Figure shows the smallest, mean, and largest abundance estimate. Projects are ranked by mean estimate. 




## Example of a Summary Table

**Table 1:** Project inventory.

``` {r message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
table.df <- summary.df %>% select(Stock,Watershed,SurveyType, NumEst, NumCV, FirstYr, LastYr)

kable(table.df)


```

## Example of Appendix Section With Project Details - Pilot Station Sonar



![](PLOTS/IndividualDashboards/TimeSeries_PilotStation.png)

**Figure A.1:** Time series of abundance estimates - Pilot Station Sonar. 



**Table A.1:** Annual estimates - Pilot Station Sonar

``` {r message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}



table.df <- main.data.df  %>% dplyr::filter(Project == "PilotStation") %>%
              select(Year,Estimate,SE,CV,Lower,Upper)


kable(table.df)


```




**Table A.2:** Inventory of Operational Changes - Pilot Station Sonar

``` {r message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}



table.df <- changes.df  %>% dplyr::filter(Project == "PilotStation") %>%
              select(Years,Component,Change_Event)


kable(table.df)


```






**Table A.3:** Inventory of Data Concerns - Pilot Station Sonar

``` {r message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}



table.df <- concerns.df  %>% dplyr::filter(Project == "PilotStation") %>%
              select(Years_Affected,	Potential_Issue)


kable(table.df)


```
